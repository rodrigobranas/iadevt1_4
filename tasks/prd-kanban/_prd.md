# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

A Kanban-based project management system that enables teams to organize and track work using visual cards that move across columns representing workflow stages. Primary users are Developers; secondary users are Team Leads and Project Managers who need visibility and lightweight coordination. The system focuses on fast, accessible drag-and-drop, essential task metadata, and clear status visibility without complex integrations.

## Goals

- Reduce average task cycle time by 15% within 60 days of adoption
- Increase weekly task throughput (cards moved to Done) by 10%
- Achieve board load time ≤ 1.5s p95 for boards up to 300 cards and 6 columns
- Maintain drag-and-drop interaction latency ≤ 16ms on supported devices
- Reach weekly active usage (WAU/MAU) ≥ 60% among onboarded developers

## User Stories

- As a Developer, I want to create and update task cards so that I can track my work.
- As a Developer, I want to drag a card between columns so that its status is updated quickly.
- As a Developer, I want to see who owns a card and when it is due so that I can prioritize.
- As a Team Lead, I want to scan a board and filter by assignee/label so that I can unblock the team.
- As a Team Lead, I want to reorder columns to reflect our workflow so that the board matches our process.

## Core Features

Describe key features and numbered functional requirements.

1. Board and Column Management
   - High-level: Minimal board construct with editable columns representing workflow stages.
   - Importance: Foundation for visualizing status.
   - How it works: Users can create, rename, reorder, and delete columns; optional board creation if multiple boards are supported.
   - Functional requirements:
     - R1: The system must allow creating columns with a required unique name per board.
     - R2: The system must allow renaming, reordering (drag), and deleting columns.
     - R3: The system must prevent deleting a column containing cards without explicit confirmation.

2. Card Management
   - High-level: Create, edit, delete cards with essential metadata.
   - Importance: Core unit of work.
   - How it works: Cards belong to one column and a board; edited inline or via a simple panel.
   - Functional requirements:
     - R4: The system must allow creating a card with at least title (required) and description (optional).
     - R5: The system must support assignee (single user), due date, labels (0..n), and priority (Low/Medium/High).
     - R6: The system must allow editing and deleting cards.
     - R7: The system must maintain card position (ordering) within a column.

3. Drag-and-Drop Interaction
   - High-level: Move cards within and across columns via drag and drop with accessible fallbacks.
   - Importance: Enables fast status changes.
   - How it works: Uses existing UI Kanban component for DnD; keyboard-accessible alternatives provided.
   - Functional requirements:
     - R8: The system must support dragging cards within a column to reorder and across columns to change status.
     - R9: The system must update card state immediately on drop with optimistic UI and eventual consistency.
     - R10: The system must provide a keyboard-accessible move (e.g., focus + arrow/shortcut) and screen-reader announcements.

4. Filtering and Basic View Controls (MVP-scope minimal)
   - High-level: Lightweight filtering by assignee and label, and column collapse/expand.
   - Importance: Improves scannability.
   - Functional requirements:
     - R11: The system must allow filtering visible cards by assignee and label.
     - R12: The system must allow collapsing/expanding columns without losing state.

## User Experience

- Personas: Developers (primary), Team Leads/PMs (secondary)
- Key flows:
  - Create column → create card → drag card across columns → edit metadata
  - Filter by assignee/label → scan work-in-progress → reorder columns
- UI/UX considerations:
  - Clear column headers, card density suitable for scanning, visible assignee and due date on card
  - Inline edit for title; panel/modal for extended fields
  - Empty states and skeletons for perceived performance
- Accessibility requirements:
  - Full keyboard navigation for lists/columns/cards
  - Screen-reader announcements on move (source, destination, position)
  - Color contrast meeting WCAG AA for text and status indicators

## High-Level Technical Constraints

- Reuse existing Kanban UI component at `frontend/src/components/ui/kibo-ui/kanban/index.tsx` for drag-and-drop and rendering.
- No third-party integrations in MVP.
- Performance/scalability targets:
  - p95 board load ≤ 1.5s for up to 300 cards and 6 columns
  - Smooth drag with frame budget ≈ 16ms on modern browsers
- Data and privacy:
  - Store minimal task metadata; no sensitive PII required for MVP
  - Basic role assumptions: authenticated user context available; simple ownership per card

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- External integrations (e.g., GitHub, Slack, calendars)
- Advanced automation rules, swimlanes, and time tracking
- Complex reporting/analytics dashboards
- Subtasks and comments (planned for later phases)
- Notifications and reminders

## Phased Rollout Plan

- MVP:
  - Columns: create, rename, reorder, delete (with confirm if not empty)
  - Cards: create, edit, delete; fields: title, description, assignee, due date, labels, priority
  - Drag-and-drop: intra/inter-column moves with optimistic updates
  - Filtering: by assignee and label; column collapse/expand
  - Accessibility: keyboard movement and announcements

- Phase 2:
  - Card comments and activity history
  - Subtasks checklist
  - WIP limits per column with warnings
  - Quick search on board; saved filters
  - Multi-board support and board templates

- Phase 3:
  - Lightweight analytics (lead time, cycle time, throughput)
  - Swimlanes and custom fields
  - Bulk actions and automations

Success criteria by phase:

- MVP: ≥ 60% WAU/MAU, p95 load ≤ 1.5s, drag latency ≤ 16ms, users complete primary flow without assistance
- Phase 2: ≥ 20% usage of comments/subtasks among active boards, reduced work-in-progress spillover
- Phase 3: Reporting used monthly by ≥ 40% of team leads

## Success Metrics

- Adoption: WAU/MAU ≥ 60% for target cohort
- Efficiency: 15% reduction in cycle time (Created → Done) over baseline
- Throughput: 10% increase in cards completed per sprint
- Performance: p95 load ≤ 1.5s; interaction latency ≤ 16ms during drag
- Quality: < 1% failed moves; a11y checks passing (WCAG AA) in CI

## Risks and Mitigations

- Accessibility of drag-and-drop may be challenging → Provide robust keyboard interactions and ARIA live updates; include a11y testing.
- Scope creep (advanced features) → Strict non-goals for MVP; phased roadmap with validation checkpoints.
- Adoption vs existing tools → Focus on speed and simplicity; provide import/export in later phases if needed.
- Data model evolution → Start with minimal fields; design for additive fields later.

## Open Questions

- Do we need multi-board support in MVP or a single default board per workspace?
- What is the exact permission model (who can create/delete columns, who can edit others’ cards)?
- Should mobile/touch interactions be first-class in MVP or deferred?
- Do we require localization (i18n) now or later?
- Do we need notifications for due dates in a later phase, and via which channel?
