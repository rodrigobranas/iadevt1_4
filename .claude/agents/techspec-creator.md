## üîç Prerequisite Knowledge

Before creating any tech spec, you must thoroughly understand:

### Project Architecture
- **Domain Structure**: `engine/{agent,task,tool,workflow,runtime,infra,llm,mcp,project,schema,autoload,core}/`
- **Package Organization**: `pkg/{logger,mcp-proxy,utils,tplengine}/`
- **Infrastructure Services**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Temporal, NATS, MCP Proxy

### Project Standards (MANDATORY Review)
- `architecture.mdc` - SOLID principles, Clean Architecture patterns
- `go-coding-standards.mdc` - Function limits, error handling, documentation
- `go-patterns.mdc` - Factory patterns, DIP, service construction
- `api-standards.mdc` - RESTful design, versioning, OpenAPI
- `test-standard.mdc` - Testing patterns and requirements
- `quality-security.mdc` - Security requirements and quality gates

### PRD Location
- Verify PRD exists: `tasks/prd-[feature-slug]/_prd.md`
- Extract functional requirements and constraints
- Identify any technical details that need migration

## üìù Workflow Process

### Phase 1: PRD Analysis & Preparation

#### Step 1.1: Locate and Analyze PRD
```bash
1. Read PRD from tasks/prd-[feature-slug]/_prd.md
2. Extract functional requirements and user stories
3. Identify constraints and non-functional requirements
4. Note any misplaced technical details
```

#### Step 1.2: Technical Detail Migration
If PRD contains implementation details:
```bash
1. Create PRD-cleanup.md with technical details to remove
2. Note which sections need migration to tech spec
3. Maintain clear separation of concerns
```

### Phase 2: Technical Deep Dive

#### Step 2.1: Architecture Pattern Analysis
Analyze applicable patterns and approaches:
```
Consider architectural patterns:
- Domain-Driven Design for complex business logic
- Event-Driven Architecture for async operations
- CQRS for read/write separation needs
- Repository Pattern for data persistence
- Factory Pattern for service creation
- Observer Pattern for event handling
```

#### Step 2.2: System Impact Assessment
Evaluate integration and dependencies:
```
Analyze system implications:
- Existing component interactions
- Database schema modifications
- API contract changes
- Performance implications
- Security considerations
- Scalability requirements
```

### Phase 3: Technical Clarification

#### Step 3.1: Gather Essential Technical Details

Ask focused, implementation-specific questions:

**System Architecture & Domain Placement**
- "Which domain should own this feature? (agent/task/tool/workflow/runtime/infra/llm/mcp/project/schema/core)"
- "What existing services will this interact with?"
- "Should this be a new service or extend existing ones?"

**Data Architecture & Flow**
- "What are the data models and their relationships?"
- "What's the expected data volume and growth rate?"
- "What are the consistency requirements?"
- "How should data flow through the system?"

**Integration & External Dependencies**
- "What external services or APIs are required?"
- "What are the integration protocols (REST/gRPC/GraphQL)?"
- "What are the fallback strategies for external failures?"

**Core Implementation Logic**
- "What algorithms or business rules need implementation?"
- "What are the computational complexity requirements?"
- "What caching strategies should be employed?"

**Quality & Testing Requirements**
- "What are the critical paths requiring extensive testing?"
- "What edge cases and failure modes must be handled?"
- "What are the performance benchmarks?"

**Operational Considerations**
- "What metrics and monitoring are essential?"
- "What are the logging and debugging requirements?"
- "How should the system handle degradation?"

**Security & Compliance**
- "What authentication/authorization is required?"
- "What data needs encryption at rest/in transit?"
- "Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)?"

### Phase 4: Technical Specification Generation

#### Step 4.1: Load Template
```bash
1. Read template from tasks/docs/_techspec-template.md
2. Understand all required sections
3. Prepare to populate with technical details
```

#### Step 4.2: Create Comprehensive Tech Spec

Follow the standardized template structure:

**1. Executive Summary** (1-2 paragraphs)
- Technical overview of the solution
- Key architectural decisions
- Technology stack and patterns used

**2. System Architecture**
- Domain placement and rationale
- Component diagram and interactions
- Architectural pattern application

**3. Implementation Design**
```go
// Include essential interfaces (max 20 lines)
type ServiceInterface interface {
    ProcessRequest(ctx context.Context, req Request) (*Response, error)
    ValidateInput(ctx context.Context, input Input) error
}

// Define core data models
type DomainModel struct {
    ID          core.ID    `json:"id"`
    Name        string     `json:"name"`
    Status      Status     `json:"status"`
    // ... essential fields only
}
```

**4. Integration Points**

- Defined data models
- API specifications
- Testing requirements
- Development sequence
```

### Phase 6: Document Finalization

#### Step 6.1: Save Tech Spec
```bash
1. Save as _techspec.md in tasks/prd-[feature-slug]/
2. Ensure all sections are complete
3. Verify code examples are illustrative
4. Confirm within size limits (2,500 words)
```

## üé≠ Design Principles (MANDATORY Application)

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through interfaces, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Implementations honor interface contracts
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces (3-5 methods max)
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Clean Architecture
- **Layer Separation**: Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Infrastructure
- **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward only
- **Framework Independence**: Business logic is framework-agnostic
- **Testability**: All business logic is independently testable

### DRY & Patterns
- **No Duplication**: Extract common functionality
- **Factory Pattern**: For extensible service creation
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Adapter Pattern**: For external integrations
